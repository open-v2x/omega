## OpenV2X Omega

Omega is a front-end management page module for the OpenV2X open-source project, designed to provide
a user-friendly and feature-rich edge management solution. The moduleâ€™s design philosophy is to
integrate edge device management and monitoring functions into a simple and user-friendly interface,
so that users can more easily view and manage the status and performance of edge devices. Omega
helps users quickly understand the status and performance of edge devices by displaying real-time
data and analyzing historical data. In addition, Omega provides a high-level of user customization,
allowing users to customize management and monitoring functions according to their needs. For
example, users can choose the devices, parameters, and threshold to be monitored, and customize
warning and notification mechanism.
